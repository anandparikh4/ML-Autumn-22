For question 1:

1) In the terminal execute the following command:
	python3 q1.py > output_q1.txt

2) The results of the code are stored in output_q1.txt

3) The directory in which the file q1.py is stored, should also have
   the file abalone.data.   

4) The graphs are obtained as pop-ups. Please close the pop-up after viewing the graph so that the code continues to execute. 

5) Libraries required are as follows:
	pandas,numpy,matplotlib,sklearn

6) The folder graphs_q1 contains the images of graphs provided in report.

7) The folder output_txt_q1 contains the .txt files of the outputs provided
   in report.

For question 2:

1) Enter the following command in your terminal-
	python3 -W ignore q2.py > output_q2.txt
   The results of the code are stored in output_q2.txt
   (-W ignore just ignores the warnings we get as mentioned in the report)	
2) The following libraries are required in you python environment to run this code-
	pandas, numpy, matplotlib, math, sklern, collections
